      <p>After setting up a profile, you can join a collaborative project or create one yourself. Whether it's production, lyrics, melody, or voice - everyone can make a contribution. It all starts with an idea, and sometimes you just need that little push to make it happen.</p>
      <p>To join a project, first search for open projects that are actively seeking what you want to contribute. Then send a request to join. You can also create your own and wait for others to send requests to join yours.</p>
      <p>If you are accepted to a project, simply upload your files for other project members to work with!</p>
